Docker file = the recipe to build the images

Image = The artifact from the docker file (immutable)

Container = A running instance of an image

Docker compose = A way of running multiple containers in the same env (by handling the order of execution)


Why have seperate images and containers for 'dbserver' and 'webserver'?
    - It is mainly about how long it takes for each container to be built. It is therefore beneficial for us to have a seperate websever which is composed of the dbserver
      thus making the combination into a whole working server
