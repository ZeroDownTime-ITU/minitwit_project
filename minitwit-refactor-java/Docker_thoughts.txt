Docker file = the recipe to build the images

Image = The artifact from the docker file (immutable)

Container = A running instance of an image

Docker compose = A way of running multiple containers in the same env (by handling the order of execution)


Why have seperate images and containers for 'dbserver' and 'webserver'?
    - It is mainly about how long it takes for each container to be built. It is therefore beneficial for us to have a seperate websever which is composed of the dbserver
      thus making the combination into a whole working server

For now it might be smarter that we include the maven dependency in the docker file since we are still developing
But later on it might be better to not include it (for better build times, even though it does not take long to build)


NOTES ON DOCKER-COMPOSE.YML

  We get images from the could here (the maven version we are using) as well as we are running this
